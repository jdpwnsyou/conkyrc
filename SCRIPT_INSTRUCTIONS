I have included several scripts that will act as a means to start/stop a connection to a VPN.

Once edited, these can be placed in your /usr/local/bin folder so that they can be run from any folder since /usr/local/bin should be within your PATH variable.  

These must be edited to reflect your own setup in several ways.

Firstly, you must have a VPN connection setup through openvpn and ready to be run as a service.

This means that when you run 'systemctl start openvpn@<conf_file>.service' your VPN starts correctly.  See wiki for details.

Note: if you lose Internet connection after starting the VPN your DNS is probably not resolving correctly and can be fixed with openresolv!

If the above is complete, all that is required is that the paths in the scripts listed above and in the .conkyrc are changed to reflect your system's setup.

Once complete, this will drastically lower the number of calls to ipinfo.io and keep you from going over quota (fucking free services, amirite??)

The killconky script DOES NOT need editing and a restartvpn script is forthcoming...
